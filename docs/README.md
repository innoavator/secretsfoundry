## About

SecretsFoundry aims to make secret management easier for developers by allowing env files to contain links to paths of the variables in different secret managers.  The key advantages of SecretsFoundry are:

1. Works with muliple secret managers like AWS Parameter Store, AWS Secret Manager, Hashicorp vault. 
2. All env variables are version controlled using Git and can follow the Gitops methodology.
3. Requires no change to the production  or CI/CD environment while adding / removing environment variables.
