# Welcome

Secretsfoundry removes the need for installing libraries for using `.env` files in your project by reading the `.env` file and exporting it as a `env` variable. Seems similar to other libraries, but wait we have something different. Variables defined in `.env` are not just limited to simple strings or acess\_keys They themselves can be variables with some predefined syntax. Now that's using `.env` but with more powers.

Checking if sync is working.
