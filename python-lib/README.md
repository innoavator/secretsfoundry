# How to use the python library

once you run `npm run package`, you will get a `dist` folder in the `jsii` project.

- copy the `.whl` file to a python project folder
- create an virtual environment (optional, but recommended)
- `python -m pip install <.whl file>`

You can import the library using `servicefoundry.secretsfoundry` and use it as a python library
